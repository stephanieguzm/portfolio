Originally, this led me to pursue a career in social work where I helped families find safety and stability after homelessness. I collaborated with people, problem-solving and connecting them with the tools and resources to work through each challenge. I thrived in spaces that channelled my creativity, problem-solving, and systems thinking.`,
`I reached a point when I was ready to grow in a new career and solve issues with greater impact, and software development quickly became my outlet. Seeing my first web page come to life on my screen opened up a world of possibilities. I had discovered a new way to make an impact and I haven’t looked back.`,
`Now as a developer, my goal is to build tools and products that improve people's quality of life. Fueled by my curiosity and eagerness to solve problems that create social good, I'm excited to contribute my technical skills to an organization that's building digital products that positively impact the way people live.`]
