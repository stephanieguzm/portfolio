export const PROFILE_ABOUT_TEXT = `Curious and altruistic by nature, I spent a decade in social work helping people make meaningful changes in their lives. I collaborated with people, supported them through challenges, and equipped them with tools to solve their problems. I thrived in spaces that channelled my creativity, problem-solving, and systems thinking. \nI reached a point when I was ready to grow in a new career and solve problems with greater impact, and software development quickly became my outlet. Seeing my first web page come to life on my screen opened up a world of possibilities. I had discovered a new way to make an impact and I haven’t looked back. \nHelping people learn, grow, and connect with one another is at the heart of what I do. Fueled by my curiosity and eagerness to solve problems collaboratively, I'm eager to contribute my technical skills to an organization that's building digital products that positively impact the way people live!`
